# Music-Recommender-System

The project aims to apply various ensemble learning algorithms on the KKBoxâ€™s music data and identify whether the user has listened to a song again or not.

The problem is a binary classification with an approximately equal number of observations for each class, the evaluation metric used for this experiment is the AUC score. 
The maximum AUC score achieved is approximately 72%.

The algorithms implemented are Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine, Bagging, Boosting, Stacking, and Voting algorithms.
